# Getting Started with PureScript

The basics of getting set up to use the Purescript compiler purs after installation.

## Description

The book, Functional Programming Made Easy, has many examples which I believe are beneficial if typed either in the repl or in a file. The chapters in this repository represent the examples discussed in the book.  
Additionally, there are a few things about the workflow for Purescript that I'd like to understand. Specifically, I want to know how to setup a project and also how to add the necessary files to make a project build successfully if it's retrieved from Github. There doesn't appear to be much documentation about those processes in what I've found on the internet thus far. As I get more experience or find a resource online, I'll document that information here.  
It's frustrating, when learning a new programming language to be confronted with build issues because the documentation doesn't fully explain the steps involed or the code is out of date, as is the case with the book, Purescript by Example.
